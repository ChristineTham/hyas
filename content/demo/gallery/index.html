    <h2>Gallery</h2>
    <p>This is a <strong>Gallery</strong> element. It can behave as a lightbox (when given the <code>lightbox</code> class), and you can customize its <span class="demo-controls">appearance with a number of modifiers</span>, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier (<a href="#reference-gallery">details</a>).</p>
